# Methodology & Limitations

## What this system does well
- Identifies where conversion and revenue change
- Locates leakage by segment
- Quantifies monetization efficiency

## What it does NOT do
- Prove causality
- Replace experiments
- Predict customer behavior without modeling

## Key assumptions
- Price position buckets approximate elasticity
- Conversion is driven by listing quality and dealer behavior
- Gold aggregates represent true business reality

## How to mitigate limitations
- Add A/B testing
- Add causal uplift models
- Add dealer and pricing experiments
