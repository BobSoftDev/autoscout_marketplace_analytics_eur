# Executive KPI Sanity Checks

These checks prevent executives from seeing misleading dashboards.

## Trend logic
- If Searches ↑ and Sales ↓ → conversion issue
- If Sales ↑ and Revenue ↓ → monetization leakage
- If Revenue ↑ but Sales flat → pricing or fee capture change

## Alert conditions
| Condition | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Sales MoM < -10% | Severe demand or conversion shock |
| Revenue per lead MoM < -10% | Monetization failure |
| Contact→Sale drop > 5pp | Dealer or pricing issue |

These should be reviewed monthly in leadership meetings.
