# AutoScout Marketplace Conversion & Monetization Analytics (EUR)

## 1. Purpose
This project delivers an executive-grade analytics platform that explains:
- Where marketplace growth comes from
- Where conversion and revenue leak
- Which actions will most increase successful vehicle transactions and monetization

It is designed to operate as a **production analytics system**, not a demo.

## 2. Business Scope
The marketplace earns money from:
- Paid listings
- Dealer subscriptions
- Lead fees
- Featured placements
- Successful vehicle transactions

This platform covers the full:
**Search → Contact → Sale → Revenue** lifecycle.

## 6. Success Criteria
This project is successful if:
- Executives can explain any revenue change in under 5 minutes

- Monetization quality improves even when volume is flat
- Decisions are made using Gold KPIs, not ad-hoc BI calculations

## 7. What This Is Not
This system does not:
- Predict the future
- Prove causality
- Replace experimentation
- Replace operational CRM or dealer systems

It provides **diagnostic truth** that enables those capabilities.
